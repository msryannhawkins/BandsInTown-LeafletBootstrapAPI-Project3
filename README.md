Mapping Popular Artist's Past, Upcoming, and All Events using BandsInTown API
Jo Sanchez | Danny Flanagan | Ryann Hawkins 

This project is an ETL project where we collected music artists' data from the BandsInTown API, and looked to draw a comparison between event locations as well as upcoming and past events.

  EDIT
Since the data that feeds the charts is not hosted online, you will need to run the following steps to obtain the data to fill the charts so they generate locally:

Run the Load.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to put the necessary files into a database
This only needs to be done one time
In the app.py file, start a terminal and start the API Flask by using the following command: python app.py
This will need to be done every time you launch the page
Only then will the proper data generate, and the charts will load properly. Enjoy!
